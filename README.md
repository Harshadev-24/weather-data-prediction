## Overview
This repository demonstrates weather prediction using machine learning. It analyzes meteorological data, builds predictive models, and visualizes results.

**Key Features**:
- Data cleaning & exploration
- Feature engineering
- Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Evaluation and visualization of predictions

## Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:


## Dataset
  **Description:**
  This dataset contains historical global weather records from 1750 to 1954, designed for climate and temperature analysis and prediction tasks in data science and machine learning projects.

  **Features/Columns:**
 - dt: Date of record (YYYY-MM-DD).
 - LandAverageTemperature: Average land temperature recorded (°C).
 - LandAverageTemperatureUncertainty: Uncertainty value for the above temperature.
 - LandMaxTemperature: Maximum land temperature measured (°C).
 - LandMaxTemperatureUncertainty: Uncertainty in max temperature.
 - LandMinTemperature: Minimum land temperature measured (°C).
 - LandMinTemperatureUncertainty: Uncertainty in min temperature.
 - LandAndOceanAverageTemperature: Average combined temperature of land and ocean (°C).
 - LandAndOceanAverageTemperatureUncertainty: Uncertainty in combined temperature.
  

## Usage
Open `weather_Data_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run step-by-step to reproduce results.

## Results
Model performance metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** XX
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** XX

Sample predictions and visualizations included in the notebook.
